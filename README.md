# COSC499 Individual Exercise

## General Information

This individual Git exercise is a small programming assignment to ensure I am familiar with how to use Git by cloning the repository locally, creating and working on branches, and pushing my work appropriately.

A video is included as a short demo to show:
* my Github account with the repository
* the program running
* how to make a simple change locally and push to origin
* how to make an inline comment in my code
* how to commit the change and push to origin
* the results of the successful push
* the README

## Language and Modules

This application was created with the following language and module versions:

- Python 3.10.7

## Features

This application presents itself as a mini simulation where the user starts by becoming the owner of a winery. With a list of 5 wine names and wine scores, the program creates a list of Wine objects (with attributes ID, name, and score). This list can be printed neatly and read easily with the list name on top.
